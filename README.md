# HiddenObjects
Materials and shaders to make objects invisible behind others or make them only visible behind others using stencils in Unity. The shaders are adapted from the ones found on [this tutorial](https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/2018/08/18/stencil-buffers.html).

To use it just drop the *Transparency Manager* prefab at the scene and add references to the objects you want to hide and the one that hides them on the inspector.
